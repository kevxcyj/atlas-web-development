         <h4 style="text-align: center; background-color: lightsalmon; font-size: 25px;"> Why I chose Atlas and what I want to do with my FS knowledge</h3>


            <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">
                I chose to come to Atlas because I wanted to expand what I know about tech and coding. I went to university 
                and decided that I wanted to do something that was differnt. It was a nice experience for a year, 
                but I want to stay there for 4 years. So I decided to look for something that would help me get learn 
                what I wanted to quicker, without the extras.
             </p>
       
             <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">
               I don't really know exactly what I want to do after this. Part of me wants to be apart of a 
               startup or something like that, but I also like the idea of bouncing around and going 
               different places, doing different things. I mostly just want to be apart of something that allows me 
               to work with computers and coding, but also the oppurtunity to travel and see new tech
